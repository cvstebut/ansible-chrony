# A large value of 10 indicates that the clock is so many hops away from a
# reference clock that its time is unreliable. If the computer ever has access
# to another computer which is ultimately synchronized to a reference clock,
# it will almost certainly be at a stratum less than 10. Therefore, the choice
# of a high value like 10 for the local command prevents the machine’s own time
# from ever being confused with real time, were it ever to leak out to clients
# that have visibility of real servers.
#
# N.B. this value can be set to null, which results in the `local stratum` option being omitted entirely

# The log command indicates that certain information is to be logged. It

# measurements
# This option logs the raw NTP measurements and related information to a file
# called measurements.log.
#
# statistics
# This option logs information about the regression processing to a file called
# statistics.log.
#
# tracking
# This option logs changes to the estimate of the system’s gain or loss rate,
# and any slews made, to a file called tracking.log.
#
# rtc
# This option logs information about the system’s real-time clock.
#
# refclocks
# This option logs the raw and filtered reference clock measurements to a file
# called refclocks.log.
#
# tempcomp
# This option logs the temperature measurements and system rate compensations
# to a file called tempcomp.log.

# The maxupdateskew parameter is the threshold for determining whether an
# estimate is too unreliable to be used.
# By default, the threshold is 1000 ppm
# Typical values for skew-in-ppm might be 100 for a dial-up connection to
# servers over a telephone line, and 5 or 10 for a computer on a LAN

# maxstep (see https://chrony.tuxfamily.org/doc/4.0/chrony.conf.html#makestep)
# Normally chronyd will cause the system to gradually correct any time offset,
# by slowing down or speeding up the clock as required.
# In certain situations, the system clock might be so far adrift that this
# slewing process would take a very long time to correct the system clock.
# This directive forces chronyd to step the system clock if the adjustment
# is larger than a threshold value, but only if there were no more clock
# updates since chronyd was started than a specified limit (a negative value
# can be used to disable the limit).
# This is particularly useful when using reference clocks, because the
# initstepslew directive works only with NTP sources.
# An example of the use of this directive is:
#
# chrony_makestep: {threshold: 0.1 3}
#
# Sometimes - e.g. on virtual machines, that can be suspended
# and resumed - you may want to let chronyd step the clock on any update,
# not just the first ones after it starts:
# (see https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/484474)
#
# chrony_makestep: {threshold: 1, limit: -1}
